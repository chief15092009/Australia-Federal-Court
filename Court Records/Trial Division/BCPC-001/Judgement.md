**INTRODUCTION**

[1] The Applicant, iiiKylerLaw, brought an application before this court seeking to set aside a warrant issued against them under the case reference AW20240806BCPC37-1.

**REASONS FOR RULING**

[2] The Petitioner’s Counsel presented arguments in their factum, detailing the reasons why the warrant should be quashed, including the assertion that the Petitioner was bound by a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) with the Vancouver Fire and Rescue Service. The Petitioner’s Counsel claimed that this NDA justified the Petitioner’s actions of withholding information and refusing to answer the question under which the disobedience of the court order was found.

[3] While the court acknowledges the Petitioner’s legal obligations under the NDA, the court also recognizes its duty to ensure that the administration of justice is not compromised. The court carefully weighed the Petitioner’s contractual obligations against the necessity of full disclosure in legal proceedings.

[4] It was found that the Petitioner engaged in ex-parte communication by contacting the presiding judge, the Hon. JorgexAce, whilst testifying, outside the presence of the opposing party. This act constitutes a violation of court procedures and undermines the principles of fairness and impartiality that are fundamental to the judicial process.

[5] The Supreme Court of British Columbia, in **Vaillancourt v. The Queen, [1981] 1 S.C.R. 69**, established that “*the refusal to be sworn or testify constitutes contempt of court committed ‘in the face’ of the Court.*” Furthermore, in **In Re Gerson / In Re Nightingale, [1946] S.C.R. 538**, it was held that “*the refusal of the petitioners to be sworn was a direct defiance of a lawful order of the Court and an attempt to frustrate the course of justice. Moreover, it was a contempt in the face of the Court.*”

[6] The court finds that the Petitioner’s failure to disclose information relevant to the case, despite the existence of the NDA, constitutes contempt of court. The court must prioritise the integrity of judicial proceedings over the Petitioner’s contractual obligations, particularly when those obligations are used as a shield to withhold pertinent information.

[7] The significance of the Petitioner’s ex-parte communication cannot be overstated, as it directly contravenes the ethical standards expected in legal proceedings and raises concerns about the fairness of the process. This breach of protocol further justifies the court’s decision to uphold the warrant.

[8] The crown did not contest this application.

**RULING**

[9] The Petitioner’s application to set aside the warrant is **denied**. The court finds that the Petitioner’s actions, including the unauthorised ex-parte communication and the withholding of relevant information under the guise of an NDA, warrant a finding of contempt of court.
